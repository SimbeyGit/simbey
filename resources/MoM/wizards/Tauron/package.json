			description: "Based on his summary in the game's Manual, Tauron seems to be an invader or exile from the plane of Chaos. Noble-ranked demons of that realm, such as the Efreet, will sometimes trickle into Arcanus through the Nodes or be summoned by a Chaos practitioner... but it is extraordinary for one to venture out and establish a Wizard Fortress. Looking across his new domain, Tauron sees an opportunity to rampage across unspoiled lands and haughtily wield his superhuman capabilities in Chaos magic.\r\n\r\nTauron has the appearance of a medium-statured human male with green eyes, sporting a black van dyke beard. He wears a heavy red and gold-trim mantle over grey.",
